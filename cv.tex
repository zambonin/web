  \headerrow{About \\[1ex] \scriptsize{(rev. \DTMtoday)}}{
    I am an information security consultant with 7+ years of experience and
    a solid academic background. I was a former lead of technical research and
    development for the Brazilian Digital Signature Standard. I specialize in
    quantum-safe cryptography and public-key infrastructures.

      Some of my roles include acting as a consultant on digital signature
      standards; a ceremony operator deploying e-voting platforms;
      a quantum-safe blockchain researcher; and a computer forensic examiner
      measuring the accuracy of pictures from speed enforcement cameras.
      Maybe I can also help you, get in touch!

      From 2020 onwards, I led the team whose job is to improve, maintain and
      add features to the Brazilian Digital Signature Standard official
      implementation, all derived applications, and normative documents. As
      a result, any Brazilian citizen is able to generate and verify digitally
      signed files per the latest standards.
      \vspace{1ex}

      Until 2019, as a software developer at that same team, I implemented
      several large new features to the signature verification service, such as
      a new responsive web interface, a REST API, and support for verification
      of CMS signatures.

      I was a teaching assistant for a probability and statistics class as

\rulesection{Personal values and interests}

I strive to solve problems and deliver elegant solutions with great efficiency,
attention to detail, and a minimal number of tools---most likely AWK, Bash,
tmux and Vim.

I'm also committed to bring out the best of the people working alongside me,
through frequent knowledge transfers and a constant feedback loop.

I'm enthusiastic about astronomy, immersive sim games, IBM keyboards
specifically older than myself and most songs with a saxophone line. 8)
